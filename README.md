Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
great potential in enhancing recommender systems. However, the
challenge of accurately recommending restaurants to cold-start
users, who have no historical data, remains a considerable hurdle.
In this paper, we propose a method to address the practical scenario
of cold-start user restaurant recommendation, that requires only a
few input keywords from the users. We investigate the efficacy of
combining retrieval models with LLMs which function as rankers
in recommendation. The process involves an initial stage where
keyword-driven retrieval models are used to obtain restaurant can-
didates. This step mitigates the limitations of LLMs in processing
extensive tokens and reducing the risk of generating misleading in-
formation. Subsequently, we employ various prompting strategies
with LLMs including zero-shot and few-shot, and explore in-context
instruction learning by integrating multiple examples directly into
the LLM prompts. Our evaluation, conducted on a Yelp restaurant
dataset comprising reviews and ratings from seven cities globally,
indicates that our proposed system offers considerable improve-
ments in recommendation quality. Notably, integrating in-context
instructions with LLMs as rankers significantly boosts the recom-
mender systemâ€™s performance.
